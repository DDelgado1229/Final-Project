    <h1><b>How To Visually Communicate</b></h1>
    <h2>By Denzel Noah Delgado</h2>
    <p>Usually an aspect of design that is overlooked is the <b>design process</b> itself. Here I will tell you my story of how I approach design and ultimately art. From a casual hobbiest to professional commission.  </p>
    <h3><b>Sketching/Drafting</b></h3>

<p>Just by looking at the above picture, you can make the assumption of the style of art being done. For me being able to tell what style is being evoked us vital. Art can and should always be able to communicate without the use of words/captioning. For those who do not know, this is in the vien if anime/manga. As you can imagine the first step of design is getting the project's vision straight. I knew my design had to encompass the art style, and encompass enough visual queues to look like me. Its impossible to have a drawing be an 100% match to someone, but by covering most of the visual aspects of the reference, the illusion that it is the same or at least close is created. Here i captured my hair, facial structure, and eyebrows. Features that are prominent in anime/manga. </p>

    <h4><b>Finalization</b></h4>
    <img src="C:\Users\trans\Creative Cloud Files\New folder (2)\Anime Portrait.gif" alt="The anime potrait of myself after going through Adobe illustrator and photoshop" width="750"/>
    <p>After reaching a sketch, next I begin my "inking" process. This piece was my first attempt at taking a traditional sketch and creating a digital variation of it. I used the pen tool on illustrator to trace over the pdf image of my sketch. After finishing the outline i began coloring in the face and general bold colors on illustrator. I kept in mind the visual contrast necessary to create an effective and bold design. Having opposing colors, shapes, fonts, and opacities are easy ways to build contrast in your designs. The use of photoshop in design varies depending on the designer. Some design straight onto photoshop, others sparringly use it. I'm a part of the latter, preffering photoshop as a way to create highlights, shadows, and alter little aspects and design principles like proximity, contrast and repition. Everything in this image besides my anime portrait is added through photoshop. </p>
